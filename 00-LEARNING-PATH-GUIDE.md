## üìã Overview

Our system handles critical capital market operations using:
- **TCL**: Primary scripting language for business logic
- **Shell Scripts**: System automation and integration
- **Unix/Linux**: Operating system environment
- **SQL**: Database operations and queries
- **Tidal**: Job scheduling and workflow management
- **Python**: Supporting scripts and utilities
