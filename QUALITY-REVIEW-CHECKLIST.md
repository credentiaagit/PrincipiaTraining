## Common Issues to Fix

### Issue Types Found:

1. **Commands without context**
   - Example: `g+s` without explaining what 's' is
   - Solution: Add "What is X?" section before commands

2. **Abbreviations without expansion**
   - Example: Using "CTE" without saying "Common Table Expression"
   - Solution: Always expand on first use

3. **Technical terms assumed**
   - Example: Using "recursive" without explaining what it means
   - Solution: Add brief explanation or link to glossary

4. **Options without purpose**
   - Example: `-R` flag without saying it means "recursive"
   - Solution: Comment every option/flag

5. **Concepts without examples**
   - Example: Explaining theory without showing practical use
   - Solution: Add real-world examples

## Quality Standards

### Every New Concept Should Have:

1. **Definition**: What is it?
2. **Purpose**: Why do we use it?
3. **Syntax**: How do we use it?
4. **Example**: Show it in action
5. **Context**: When/where to use it
6. **Warning**: Common pitfalls (if any)

### Example of Good Explanation:

```markdown
### grep - Search for Patterns

**What is grep?**
grep (Global Regular Expression Print) is a command-line utility for 
searching text files for lines matching a pattern.

**Why use grep?**
- Find specific text in files quickly
- Filter log files for errors
- Search through multiple files at once

**Basic Syntax:**
grep [options] pattern [file...]

**Common Options:**
- `-i` : Case-insensitive search
- `-r` : Search recursively in directories
- `-n` : Show line numbers
- `-v` : Invert match (show non-matching lines)

**Example:**
grep "ERROR" application.log
# Finds all lines containing "ERROR" in the log file

**When to use:**
- Analyzing log files
- Finding specific code patterns
- Filtering command output
```
