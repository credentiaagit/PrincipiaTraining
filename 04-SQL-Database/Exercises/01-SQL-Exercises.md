FROM trades
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

FROM trades t
INNER JOIN traders tr ON t.trader_id = tr.trader_id;
```

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    t.trade_id,
    t.symbol,
    s.company_name,
    t.quantity,
    t.price,
    t.quantity * t.price AS value,
    tr.trader_name,
    tr.department
FROM trades t
JOIN symbols s ON t.symbol = s.symbol
JOIN traders tr ON t.trader_id = tr.trader_id
ORDER BY value DESC;
```

## Level 4: Advanced Queries

### Exercise 7: Subqueries
**Task**: Find trades with above-average price.

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM trades)
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

### Exercise 8: Complex Aggregation
**Task**: Show top 5 traders by total trade value with department info.

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    tr.trader_name,
    tr.department,
    COUNT(t.trade_id) AS trade_count,
    SUM(t.quantity * t.price) AS total_value
FROM trades t
JOIN traders tr ON t.trader_id = tr.trader_id
GROUP BY tr.trader_id, tr.trader_name, tr.department
ORDER BY total_value DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Level 5: Real-World Scenarios

### Exercise 9: Daily Summary Report
**Task**: Create a daily summary showing:
- Total trades
- Total value
- Number of unique symbols
- Average trade value

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    trade_date,
    COUNT(*) AS total_trades,
    COUNT(DISTINCT symbol) AS unique_symbols,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_value,
    AVG(quantity * price) AS avg_value,
    MIN(price) AS min_price,
    MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM trades
WHERE trade_date = '2024-10-28'
GROUP BY trade_date;
```

### Exercise 10: Position Calculation
**Task**: Calculate current positions from trade history.

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT 
    account_id,
    symbol,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN side = 'BUY' THEN quantity
        WHEN side = 'SELL' THEN -quantity
    END) AS net_position
FROM trades
WHERE status = 'SETTLED'
GROUP BY account_id, symbol
HAVING SUM(CASE

END) != 0
ORDER BY account_id, symbol;
```
