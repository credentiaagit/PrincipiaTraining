## Introduction to Unix

### What is Unix?
Unix is a powerful, multi-user, multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs. It has influenced many modern operating systems including Linux, macOS, and BSD.

### Key Characteristics
- **Multi-user**: Multiple users can access the system simultaneously
- **Multitasking**: Can run multiple processes at the same time
- **Portability**: Written in C, making it portable across hardware
- **Security**: Strong permission and security model
- **Hierarchical File System**: Everything is organized in a tree structure
- **Command-line Interface**: Powerful shell for system interaction

### Why Unix for Capital Markets?
- **Stability**: Proven reliability for mission-critical applications
- **Performance**: Efficient resource management for high-volume transactions
- **Security**: Robust security features for sensitive financial data
- **Automation**: Powerful scripting capabilities
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale enterprise applications

## Unix Architecture

Unix architecture consists of four main layers:

```
+----------------------------------+
|         Users/Applications       |
+----------------------------------+
|         Shell (CLI)              |
+----------------------------------+
|   System Calls & Libraries       |
+----------------------------------+
|      Kernel (Core OS)            |
+----------------------------------+
|         Hardware                 |
+----------------------------------+
```

### 1. Kernel
- Core of the operating system
- Manages hardware resources
- Handles:
  - Process management
  - Memory management
  - Device management
  - File system management

### 2. Shell
- Command-line interpreter
- Interface between user and kernel
- Common shells:
  - **bash** (Bourne Again Shell) - Most common
  - **sh** (Bourne Shell) - Original shell
  - **ksh** (Korn Shell) - Popular in enterprises
  - **csh/tcsh** (C Shell) - C-like syntax
  - **zsh** (Z Shell) - Extended features

### 3. System Utilities
- Standard programs and commands
- Categories:
  - File management (ls, cp, mv, rm)
  - Text processing (grep, sed, awk)
  - Process management (ps, top, kill)
  - Network utilities (ping, ssh, scp)

### 4. Applications
- User programs
- Custom scripts
- Database systems
- Web servers

## File System Hierarchy

Unix uses a hierarchical file system structure starting from root (/).

```
/                          (Root - top of file system)
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/                   (Essential command binaries)
â”œâ”€â”€ boot/                  (Boot loader files)
â”œâ”€â”€ dev/                   (Device files)
â”œâ”€â”€ etc/                   (System configuration files)
â”œâ”€â”€ home/                  (User home directories)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user2/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                   (System libraries)
â”œâ”€â”€ opt/                   (Optional application software)
â”œâ”€â”€ tmp/                   (Temporary files)
â”œâ”€â”€ usr/                   (User programs and data)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin/               (User commands)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/               (Libraries)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ local/             (Local programs)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ share/             (Shared data)
â””â”€â”€ var/                   (Variable data)
    â”œâ”€â”€ log/               (Log files)
    â”œâ”€â”€ tmp/               (Temporary files)
    â””â”€â”€ spool/             (Spool directories)
```

### Important Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Example Contents |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `/bin` | Essential commands | ls, cp, mv, rm, cat |
| `/etc` | Configuration files | passwd, hosts, fstab |
| `/home` | User home directories | /home/john, /home/mary |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files | Session files, temp data |
| `/usr/bin` | User commands | Additional utilities |
| `/var/log` | Log files | syslog, application logs |
| `/opt` | Optional software | Third-party applications |

---

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Everything is a File
In Unix, almost everything is treated as a file:
- Regular files (documents, programs)
- Directories (folders)
- Devices (hard drives, terminals)
- Pipes and sockets

### 2. File Types

```bash
# View file types with ls -l
-rw-r--r--   # Regular file
drwxr-xr-x   # Directory
lrwxrwxrwx   # Symbolic link
crw-rw-rw-   # Character device
brw-rw----   # Block device
```

**First character indicates type:**
- `-` : Regular file
- `d` : Directory
- `l` : Symbolic link
- `c` : Character device
- `b` : Block device
- `p` : Named pipe
- `s` : Socket

### 3. Users and Groups

**Users:**
- Every user has a unique username and User ID (UID)
- Root user (UID 0) has complete system access
- Regular users have limited permissions

**Groups:**
- Users belong to one or more groups
- Each group has a Group ID (GID)
- Used for shared resource access

**View current user information:**
```bash
whoami          # Current username
id              # User and group IDs
groups          # Groups you belong to
```

### 4. File Permissions

Every file has three permission sets:
- **Owner (User)**: The file creator
- **Group**: Users in the file's group
- **Others**: Everyone else

Three types of permissions:
- **r (read)**: View file contents (4)
- **w (write)**: Modify file (2)
- **x (execute)**: Run as program (1)

**Example:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 john  staff  1024 Oct 28 10:30 report.txt
```
- `-`: Regular file
- `rw-`: Owner can read and write
- `r--`: Group can only read
- `r--`: Others can only read

### 5. Processes

- A process is a running instance of a program
- Each process has:
  - **PID (Process ID)**: Unique identifier
  - **PPID (Parent Process ID)**: Parent process
  - **Owner**: User who started it
  - **Priority**: CPU scheduling priority

### 6. Standard Streams

Every process has three standard streams:
- **stdin (0)**: Standard input (keyboard)
- **stdout (1)**: Standard output (screen)
- **stderr (2)**: Standard error (screen)

These can be redirected:
```bash
command > output.txt       # Redirect stdout to file
command 2> error.txt       # Redirect stderr to file
command < input.txt        # Read stdin from file
command >> output.txt      # Append stdout to file
```

## Getting Started

### Logging In

**Local Login:**
1. Enter username at login prompt
2. Enter password (characters won't display)
3. Shell prompt appears

**Remote Login (SSH):**
```bash
ssh username@hostname
# Example: ssh john@server.company.com
```

### The Shell Prompt

Common prompt formats:
```bash
$                          # Regular user (sh, bash)
%                          # Regular user (csh, tcsh)
#                          # Root user
[user@host ~]$             # User@hostname with current directory
```

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
ls                         # Command only
ls -l                      # Command with option
ls -l /home                # Command with option and argument
ls -la /home /tmp          # Multiple arguments
```

### Getting Help

```bash
man command                # Manual page for command
man ls                     # Manual for ls command
info command               # Info documentation
command --help             # Quick help
whatis command             # Brief description
```

**Navigating man pages:**
- `Space`: Next page
- `b`: Previous page
- `/text`: Search for text
- `n`: Next search result
- `q`: Quit

### Your First Commands

```bash
# Who am I?
whoami

# Current date and time
date

# Calendar
cal

# Current directory
pwd

# List files
ls

# Clear screen
clear

# Exit/logout
exit
```

## Capital Markets Use Case

### Scenario: End-of-Day Processing System

In our capital market system:

1. **User Environment**: 
   - Traders and analysts login to Unix servers
   - Each has their own home directory with configurations

2. **File Organization**:
   ```
   /opt/trading/
   â”œâ”€â”€ bin/           (Trading applications)
   â”œâ”€â”€ config/        (Configuration files)
   â”œâ”€â”€ data/          (Market data)
   â”œâ”€â”€ logs/          (Application logs)
   â””â”€â”€ scripts/       (TCL and shell scripts)
   ```

3. **Process Flow**:
   - Market data arrives in `/opt/trading/data/`
   - TCL scripts process transactions
   - Results stored in database
   - Log files track all operations
   - Shell scripts manage file movements

4. **Security**:
   - Different users have different access levels
   - Production files are read-only for analysts
   - Only operators can execute certain scripts

5. **Automation**:
   - Cron jobs schedule nightly processes
   - Scripts validate and move files
   - Email alerts on errors
