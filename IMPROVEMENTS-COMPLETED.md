## ✨ Key Improvements

### Before:
```bash
# SUID (Set User ID) - Run as file owner
chmod u+s program          # 4755
```
**Problem**: What does "run as file owner" mean? Why? Security implications?

### After:
```markdown
#### 1. SUID (Set User ID) - The 's' in u+s

**What is SUID?**
When set on an executable file, the program runs with the permissions 
of the file's **owner**, not the user who executes it.

**Why use SUID?**
Allows regular users to execute programs that need elevated privileges.
Example: passwd command needs root access to modify /etc/shadow file.

**Security Warning**: Very dangerous if misused! Only set on trusted executables.

[... followed by 40+ lines of detailed explanation, examples, 
security warnings, use cases, and capital markets scenarios]
